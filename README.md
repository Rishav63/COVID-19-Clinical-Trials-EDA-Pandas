# COVID-19 Clinical Trials: EDA
 COVID-19 Clinical Trials: Exploratory Data Analysis  This repository contains a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of COVID-19 clinical trials. The primary goal of this project is to uncover trends, patterns, and insights from the dataset, leveraging Python and popular data analysis libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

## Project Overview

As the world faced the COVID-19 pandemic, clinical trials became a crucial part of understanding and combating the disease. This project analyzes data from these trials to answer key questions, such as:
- What are the characteristics of the trials conducted?
- How are trials distributed across different parameters (e.g., phases, locations)?
- What insights can we gain from the data to support future research?

By processing and visualizing the data, this project provides valuable insights into the nature and scope of COVID-19 clinical trials.

## Features and Capabilities

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaning and preparing raw data for analysis.
   - Handling missing values and inconsistent formats.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Statistical analysis of the dataset to understand its structure and attributes.
   - Identification of trends, distributions, and correlations.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Creation of meaningful charts and graphs using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
   - Visual representation of key findings for better understanding.

## Technologies Used

The analysis is conducted using Python, with the following libraries:
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**: For creating informative and aesthetically pleasing visualizations.
